# CFT

This GitHub Repo has been setup to host the code I have used regarding my paper. for the sake of clarity, all the files I have said in this repo are maked .py file, this is just a common save point. a Majority of the computations were done on sageMath, and rahter than share my notebook, I will host the relevant cell blocks here. each file has been ran as single cell block on Sage. 

M_n_gcd ---- is the first attempt at generating prime list 
analyze.prime.ladder.py is also first runs of computations

files marked "b_n..." ------ has to do with the recurrence and 0 mod p 


coefficient_g_t  ----- computes coefficents of the reciporcal G(t) 

angle_analysis, gaussian_chart, geometric test, hecke test, are tests ran on the base case identity prime ladder list

k_search, heenger.fields ladder_analysis_a1_2.py is for the test at different parameters and searches. 

SAGELINKS INCLUDED TO EACH NOTEBOOK I HAVE RAN. SOME OF THE CELLS DO NOT WORK, BUT FOR SAKE OF CLARITY I LEFT THE NOTEBOOKS AS IS, AM IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING MY KAGGLE NOTEBOOK OVER HERE AS WELL AS ITS ANOTHER AREA I RAN COMPUTATIONS AT. 

APOLOGIES FOR NOT BEING MORE BUTTONED UP...
